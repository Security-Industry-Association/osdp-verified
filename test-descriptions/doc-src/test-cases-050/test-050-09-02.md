## Test 050-09-02 Process Sequence Zero ##

### Description ###

Exercise the PD processing of sequence 0 commands and responses.

#### PD ####

- Send a poll or command from the ACU with sequence zero. Check that PD response with a sequence zero.

#### ACU ####

- Fail if sequence is not restarted with zero for communication startup, at boot time or after a communications loss
- Fail if after receiving a sequence zero, the next command sent is not sent with sequence one
- Fail if after receiving a sequence zero response, the secure channel session is not cleared and restarted.

### Purpose ###

Sequence zero should be used only for communication startup, at boot time or after a communications loss.
A sequence zero received by the PD forces the PD to reset it's expected sequence number to 0.
A
sequence zero received by the ACU forces the ACU to reset the comminications session including secure channel and the sequence
number.
