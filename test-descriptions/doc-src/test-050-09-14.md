Test 050-09-14 Rogue SCS Poll
=============================

If a PD receives a packet with an SCS header while it
is operating unencrypted (no secure channel active) then
it must reject incoming packets with an SCS header indicating
there is an active secure channel (SCS 15 or 17.)  Specifically,
an osdp_POLL, SCS 15, with a MAC value attached, should elicit
a NAK response.

See github for revision history ("OSDP Verified") and for the conformance tool ("libosdp-conformance".)
