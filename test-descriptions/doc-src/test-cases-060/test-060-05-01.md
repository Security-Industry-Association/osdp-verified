## Test 060-05-01 Local Status ##

### Description ###

Exercise the local status response for tamper or power-on.

#### PD ####

Return osdp_LSTATR response with appropriate bits set for tamper or power-on.


#### ACU ####

Determine that the ACU sends osdp_LSTAT to check local status, and also
that an LSTATR in response to an osdp_POLL is valid.

Determine that the ACU accepts and appropriately reacts to osdp_LSTATR,
preferrably including a logged event.

### Purpose ###

Used by ACU to determine the power and tamper status (local status) of the PD when supported.

### Test action ###

#### PD ####

When sent a LSTAT command the PD will respond with the information in Table 50 and A.2. This information is checked to make sure that it contains the proper information, and that the information is handled properly by the ACU. These capabilities are then confirmed through further testing.

#### ACU ####

ACU sends osdp_LSTAT and processes osdp_LSTATR response accordingly.
