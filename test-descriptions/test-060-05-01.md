Test Action
===========

PD Test
-------

When sent a LSTAT command the PD will respond with the information in Table 50 and A.2. This information is checked to make sure that it contains the proper information, and that the information is handled properly by the ACU. These capabilities are then confirmed through further testing.

ACU Test
--------

ACU sends osdp_LSTAT 0x64 command, Table 9, and processes osdp_LSTATR response accordingly.
