Test 050-09-02 Process Sequence Zero
====================================

Purpose
-------

Sequence zero should be used only for communication startup, at boot time or after a communications loss.
A sequence zero received by the PD forces the PD to discard its last reply and to accept and process the current command.   A
sequence zero received by the ACU forces the ACU to reset the comminications session including secure channel and the sequence
number.

See github for revision history ("OSDP Verified") and for the conformance tool ("libosdp-conformance".) 

PD Action
---------

- Send a poll or command from the ACU with sequence zero. Check that PD response with a sequence zero.

ACU Action
----------

- Fail if sequence is not restarted with zero for communication startup, at boot time or after a communications loss
- Fail if after receiving a sequence zero, the next command sent is not sent with sequence one
- Fail if after receiving a sequence zero response, the secure channel session is not cleared and restarted.
