### Test 050-09-04 ADDR - Address

#### Description

##### PD

PD's must reply to commands directed to its address by setting the most
significant bit (0x80).

##### ACU

ACU's must only send addresses by setting the seven least significant
bits.

#### Purpose

Address field indicates PD address 0x00-0x7E inclusive or special
configuration address 0x7F. The seven least significant bits of the
character byte contains the address value. The PD reply sets the most
significant bit (0x80)
