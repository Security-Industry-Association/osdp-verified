### []{#anchor}Test 050-07-01 Timing

Confirm command (poll) response time is under 200 milliseconds.

##### PD

The PD REPLY_DELAY must not exceed 200 milliseconds.

##### ACU

The ACU MUST support POLL and process the response.

#### Purpose

Used to determine ability to maintain supervision via a frequent POLL
command.

#### Test action

##### PD Test

Use OSDP trace log analyzer to confirm timing.

Set up DUT in idle poll/ack configuration, collecting a trace

Run trace analyzer

Confirm analyzer does not report response time of 200ms exceeded.

##### ACU Test

Use OSDP trace log analyzer to confirm timing.

Set up DUT in idle poll/ack configuration, collecting a trace

Run trace analyzer

Confirm analyzer does not report response time of 200ms exceeded.
