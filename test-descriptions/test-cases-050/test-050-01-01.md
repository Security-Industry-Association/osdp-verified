### Test 050-01-01 Physical Interface

##### PD

Determine the device supports RS-485 communications at designated
speed(s) and address(es).

##### ACU

Determine the device supports RS-485 communications at designated
speed(s) and address(es).

#### Purpose

RS-485 2-wire is the communication protocol specified int the standard
and all devices in this test case MUST support this.
