### []{#anchor}Test 050-04-02 Support Busy Retry

Determine proper use of the BUSY response code 0x79 and the proper
processing of the BUSY response resulting in a retry sending of the
message that received a BUSY response.

##### PD

If the PD is unable to accept the command for processing due to
temporary unavailability of a resource required to process the command,
then the PD shall send the osdp_BUSY reply as defined in subclause 7.19.

##### ACU

ACU may process the osdp_BUSY response and retry the previous command.

#### Purpose

Used by PD to let ACU know that it is already processing a command and
allows the PD to determine next step, such as a retry, after its latest
command received as an osdp_BUSY .

#### Criteria

  ---------------------------- ----------
  Basic OSDP (PD)              Required
  Basic OSDP (ACU)             Optional
  Secure Channel (PD)          Required
  Secure Channel (ACU)         Optional
  BIO Match (PD)               Required
  BIO Match (ACU)              Optional
  BIO Read (PD)                Required
  BIO Read (ACU)               Optional
  Extended Packet Mode (PD)    Required
  Extended Packet Mode (ACU)   Optional
  Extended Read/Write (PD)     Required
  Extended Read/Write (ACU)    Optional
  ---------------------------- ----------

#### Test action

##### PD Test

##### ACU Test

#### When the ACU receives the osdp_BUSY reply, it may, at its discretion, choose to re-send the same command as it would if the command delivery timed out. If the ACU elects to re-send the command that caused the osdp_BUSY reply, it may do so right away, or at its option may service other PDs before re-sending the command. If, on the other hand, the ACU elects to abandon the command that received the BUSY reply, the PD shall recognize this condition (new sequence number) and shall process the new command.
