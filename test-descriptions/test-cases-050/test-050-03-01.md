### Test action ###

#### PD Test ####

Use OSDP trace to confirm character coverage.
Exercise DUT through test, collecting a trace
Confirm successful operation

Report character coverage

- Configure test stand to capture OSDP traffic.
- Configure ACU and PD to operate in secure channel.
- Run a secure channel session for at least five seconds.
- Use the trace analyzer report to check octet patterns captured.
- Confirm all possible values (0-255) are present.

#### ACU Test ####

Use OSDP trace to confirm character coverage.

Exercise DUT through full test set, collecting a trace

Confirm successful operation

Run trace analyzer

Report character coverage
