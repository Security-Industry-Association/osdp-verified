### []{#anchor}Test 050-08-01 Message Synchronization

General procedure for a PD to pass message traffic and perform message
synchronization.

##### PD

The PD MUST []{#anchor-1}maintain synchronization as described in
section 5.8. The nominal value of the inter-character timeout shall be
20 milliseconds. This parameter may need to be adjusted for special
channel timing considerations.

##### ACU

The ACU MUST maintain synchronization as described in section 5.8. The
nominal value of the inter-character timeout shall be 20 milliseconds.
This parameter may need to be adjusted for special channel timing
considerations.

#### Purpose

Used to maintain PD and ACU synchronization

#### Criteria

  ---------------------------- ----------
  Basic OSDP (PD)              Required
  Basic OSDP (ACU)             Required
  Secure Channel (PD)          Required
  Secure Channel (ACU)         Required
  BIO Match (PD)               Required
  BIO Match (ACU)              Required
  BIO Read (PD)                Required
  BIO Read (ACU)               Required
  Extended Packet Mode (PD)    Required
  Extended Packet Mode (ACU)   Required
  Extended Read/Write (PD)     Required
  Extended Read/Write (ACU)    Required
  ---------------------------- ----------

#### Test action

##### PD Test

Plug PD into RS-485 test jig and make sure it works. Requires choosing a
speed at which to test. Assumes proper inter-character timing if the
testing works.

Use a logic analyzer for further verification.

##### ACU Test

Plug ACU into RS-485 test jig and make sure it works. Requires choosing
a speed at which to test. Assumes proper inter-character timing if the
testing works.

Use a logic analyzer for further verification.
