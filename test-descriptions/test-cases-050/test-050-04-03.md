### []{#anchor}Test 050-04-03 Resend Busy 

Determine proper use of the BUSY response code 0x79 and the proper
processing of the BUSY response in the case where the BUSY response is
resent to inform the ACU that the PD is still busy processing.

##### PD

If the PD is unable to accept the command for processing due to
temporary unavailability of a resource required to process the command,
then the PD shall send the osdp_BUSY reply as defined in subclause 7.19.
In this case the command is resent if the PD remains temporarily
unavailable and informs the ACU of it state

##### ACU

ACU may process the osdp_BUSY response and determine whether to retry
the previous command.

#### Purpose

Used by PD to let ACU know that it is still processing a command and
allows the ACU to determine next step, such as a retry, after its latest
command again received an osdp_BUSY.

#### Criteria

  ---------------------------- ----------
  Basic OSDP (PD)              Required

  BIO Match (PD)               Required
  BIO Match (ACU)              Optional
  BIO Read (PD)                Required
  BIO Read (ACU)               Optional
  Extended Packet Mode (PD)    Required

#### Test action

##### PD Test

[]{#anchor-1}The PD is in a state where it issues an osdp_BUSY reply and
it maintains communication with the ACU until it can complete the
process underway and continue with processing commands.

##### ACU Test

#### When the ACU receives the osdp_BUSY reply, it may, at its discretion, choose to re-send the same command as it would if the command delivery timed out. If the ACU elects to re-send the command that caused the osdp_BUSY reply, it may do so right away, or at its option may service other PDs before re-sending the command.
