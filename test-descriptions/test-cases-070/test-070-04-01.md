### Test 070-04-01 PDID Device Identification

Determine the proper response to the osdp_PDID command as indicated in
Table 48.

##### PD

PD MUST properly respond to the PDID command with proper responses for
the device under test.

##### ACU

ACU MUST accept and process the response.

#### Purpose

Used so that the PD can provide the ACU the device details. This is used
to determine system components including current firmware versions. It
can also be used by generic tools that simulate the ACU command to
capture device details for device lifecycle management and also to
determine if the devices in hand meet expectations and match other
labeling on the device and packaging to identify the device.

#### Test action

##### PD Test

Send a osdp_PDID command to the PD and determine that the information
returned conforms with Table 48 and is accurate for the device under
test.

##### ACU Test

Confirm ACU can process PDID response and parse the information for use
by the access control system and other applications
